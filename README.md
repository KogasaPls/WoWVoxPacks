## AddOns

This collection does not have any standalone functionality. Instead, it replaces the audio files used by the following addons.

- BigWigs_Voice
- SharedMedia_Causese

**These addons must be uninstalled for the VoxPacks voices to work.** Simply disabling them ingame will not work.

## Voices

Here's a sample of the original BigWigs_Voice audio for comparison.
