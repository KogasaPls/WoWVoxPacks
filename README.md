A collection of modern TTS voices for World of Warcraft addons.

This collection does not have any standalone functionality. Instead, it replaces the audio files used by the following
addons.

- BigWigs_Voice
- SharedMedia_Causese

**These addons must be uninstalled for the VoxPacks voices to work.** Simply disabling them ingame will not work.
You can rename the .toc file of the addon, or move the addon folder out of the `Interface\AddOns` directory.
